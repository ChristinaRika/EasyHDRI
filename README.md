# EasyHDRI
Blender Addon Used for HDRI map settings in Blender
- copy this python file into your Blender Script Addon folder, then in Blender, active this addon<EasyHDRI>.
- or you can install addon in Blender, to use the zip file.
- in this addon, you can set your HDRI map path to easily create world nodes with texture.

- I'm not sure this will still work in Blender2.9.0 or later
